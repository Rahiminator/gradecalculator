The Grade Calculator is a spreadsheet-based tool created to assist students in accurately calculating their Grade Point Average (GPA) and Weighted Average Mark (WAM) across multiple units. The calculator is designed to handle multiple units, each comprising a series of assessments, with weightings summing up to 100%.

The Grade Calculator is divided into two sheets:

1. Template Sheet: A customisable blank template for users to input their unit names, assessment marks, weightings, and grades.
2. Example Sheet: A pre-filled sheet demonstrating how marks and weightings can be entered, with GPA and WAM calculated automatically.

This tool processes user inputs to compute the following metrics:

- GPA: A weighted average based on the unit's grade values, calculated on a 4-point scale.
- WAM: Reflects the average performance across all assessments in a unit, weighted by their relative importance.
